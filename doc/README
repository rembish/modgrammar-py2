The documentation in this directory is in RST format suitable for processing
with Sphinx.

To generate the full (HTML) documentation, install Sphinx and then use the
'python3 setup.py build_sphinx' command.  The resulting HTML documentation can then be found in the ../build/html directory.

Note: Sphinx v1.1 or later is required for Py3 support.
